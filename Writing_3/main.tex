\section{Creating App with current technology}
I think the App used in the story, the Tilly Here-and-Now\cite{app} can be created with current technology. This app use the GPS to find the app user in boundary of a half-mile and send the request that people need. Nowadays, we have an app called Uber\cite{uber}, peer-to-peer ride-sharing app. If we request a ride, the drivers who have installed the Uber app will get the alert when they are in certain range, and accept the request, come to the location where we are waiting and take us to the destination we want. It is really similar to the app introduced in the story, but Uber is only for the ride and the Tilly Here-and-Now is basically for all kinds of requests from anonymous users. The apps using GPS information and providing conveniences to customers by getting bounty is already used in our daily life. By using the similar technology and expand the business to variety fields, it is possible to create the app similar as the Tilly Here-and-Now in our life with current technology. 
\section{Would you use it?} 
If app is available in the market, I will use this app for sure. The main reason is the convenience. In this story, people use the Tilly Here-and-Now app to get information about Manager's Special bin at the Food Basket on Tremaine Road in Rockton. Without visiting the store, people can get information about what they want by compensating money for that. Let's think about some examples in our real life. If we want to get information about new restaurant menu and don't have time. Than we can request some information to people nearby that place by giving some bounty. It's a win-win strategy since clients can get information they want and service providers can get some compensation they need. Nowadays, in App based society, many people are taking advantage of using app for their needs. Markets operate by supply and demand. If you look at the table, we can see how the trend is changing using app compare to the traditional way. Below table shows the growth of usage of Uber, location based app for ride share, compare to the taxi and car rental.

\section{Ethical issues}
Although there are some advantages for using this kind of app, there are some risks and ethical issues as well. As it was introduced in the story, there can be a invasion of privacy. In the story, one guy receives a request to find a car plate number around the motel and eventually it was his father's car. Luckily he didn't see that car but if it was found, it could break the family relationship. Like that, people can just ask for similar request without evidence and just suspecting each other. It can ruin the trust in our society and everyone will feel that they are kept under guard. Also, the record for those privacy request is recorded on the app, and it can be used in improper way or can be traded within individuals. The other issue is that there might be some illegal requests made by using the app. For example, murder by contract, drug trades can be requested without any restrictions if there are no strict rule for using the app. For example, there is an app called TaskRabbit\cite{taskrabbit}, doing some errands by requesting. If there are no strong regulations, there might be illegal errands requested by using slangs. For example, prostitution is illegal but many people, by using random chatting app or dating app, they use slangs so that only certain group of people can understand and do prostitution and some sexual crimes. As you can see in the Figure 1, the number of crime using those apps are increasing. Strict rules to protect users from ethical problem is necessary. \enquote{App is for making people convenient, not for exposing to the crime.}
